<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c006'>THE National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
is five years old—old enough, it is believed,
to have a history; and I, who
am perhaps its first member, have
been chosen as the person to recite it.
As its work since 1910 has been set
forth in its annual reports, I shall
make it my task to show how it came
into existence and to tell of its first
months of work.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the summer of 1908, the country
was shocked by the account of the race
riots at Springfield, Illinois. Here, in
the home of Abraham Lincoln, a mob
containing many of the town’s “best
citizens,” raged for two days, killed and
wounded scores of Negroes, and drove
thousands from the city. Articles on
the subject appeared in newspapers and
magazines. Among them was one in the
<i>Independent</i> of September 3d, by William
English Walling, entitled “Race
War in the North.” After describing
the atrocities committed against the
colored people, Mr. Walling declared:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Either the spirit of the abolitionists,
of Lincoln and of Lovejoy must
be revived and we must come to treat
the Negro on a plane of absolute political
and social equality, or Vardaman
and Tillman will soon have transferred
the race war to the North.” And
he ended with these words, “Yet who
realizes the seriousness of the situation,
and what large and powerful body of
citizens is ready to come to their aid?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It so happened that one of Mr. Walling’s
readers accepted his question and
answered it. For four years I had been
studying the status of the Negro in
New York. I had investigated his housing
conditions, his health, his opportunities
for work. I had spent many
months in the South, and at the time
of Mr. Walling’s article, I was living
in a New York Negro tenement on a
Negro street. And my investigations and
my surroundings led me to believe with
the writer of the article that “the spirit
of the abolitionists must be revived.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So I wrote to Mr. Walling, and after
some time, for he was in the West, we
met in New York in the first week of
the year 1909. With us was Dr. Henry
Moskowitz, now prominent in the administration
of John Purroy Mitchell,
Mayor of New York. It was then that
the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People was born.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was born in a little room of a
New York apartment. It is to be regretted
that there are no minutes of
the first meeting, for they would make
interesting if unparliamentary reading.
Mr. Walling had spent some years in
Russia where his wife, working in the
cause of the revolutionists, had suffered
imprisonment; and he expressed his belief
that the Negro was treated with
greater inhumanity in the United
States than the Jew was treated in Russia.
As Mr. Walling is a Southerner we
listened with conviction. I knew something
of the Negro’s difficulty in securing
decent employment in the North
and of the insolent treatment awarded
him at Northern hotels and restaurants,
and I voiced my protest. Dr. Moskowitz,
with his broad knowledge of conditions
among New York’s helpless immigrants,
aided us in properly interpreting
our facts. And so we talked
and talked voicing our indignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, we wanted to do something
at once that should move the
country. It was January. Why not
choose Lincoln’s birthday, February 12,
to open our campaign? We decided,
therefore, that a wise, immediate action
would be the issuing on Lincoln’s
birthday of a call for a national conference
on the Negro question. At this
conference we might discover the beginnings,
at least, of that “large and
powerful body of citizens” of which Mr.
Walling had written.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so the meeting adjourned. Something
definite was determined upon, and
our next step was to call others into
our councils. We at once turned to
Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard, president
of the N.Y. Evening Post Company.
He received our suggestions with enthusiasm,
and aided us in securing the
co-operation of able and representative
men and women. It was he who drafted
the Lincoln’s birthday call and helped
to give it wide publicity. I give the
Call in its entirety with the signatures
since it expresses, I think, better than
anything else we have published, the
spirit of those who are active in the
Association’s cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The celebration of the Centennial
of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, widespread
and grateful as it may be, will
fail to justify itself if it takes no note
of and makes no recognition of the
colored men and women for whom the
great Emancipator labored to assure
freedom. Besides a day of rejoicing,
Lincoln’s birthday in 1909 should be
one of taking stock of the nation’s progress
since 1865.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How far has it lived up to the obligations
imposed upon it by the Emancipation
Proclamation? How far has it
gone in assuring to each and every citizen,
irrespective of color, the equality
of opportunity and equality before the
law, which underlie our American institutions
and are guaranteed by the
Constitution?</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Mr. Lincoln could revisit this
country in the flesh, he would be disheartened
and discouraged. He would
learn that on January 1, 1909, Georgia
had rounded out a new confederacy
by disfranchising the Negro, after the
manner of all the other Southern States.
He would learn that the Supreme Court
of the United States, supposedly a bulwark
of American liberties, had refused
every opportunity to pass squarely upon
this disfranchisement of millions, by
laws avowedly discriminatory and openly
enforced in such manner that the
white men may vote and black men
be without a vote in their government;
he would discover, therefore, that taxation
without representation is the lot
of millions of wealth-producing American
citizens, in whose hands rests the
economic progress and welfare of an
entire section of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He would learn that the Supreme
Court, according to the official statement
of one of its own judges in the
Berea College case, has laid down the
principle that if an individual State
chooses, it may ‘make it a crime for
white and colored persons to frequent
the same market place at the same time,
or appear in an assemblage of citizens
convened to consider questions of a
public or political nature in which all
citizens, without regard to race, are
equally interested.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“In many states Lincoln would find
justice enforced, if at all, by judges
elected by one element in a community
to pass upon the liberties and lives of
another. He would see the black men
and women, for whose freedom a hundred
thousand of soldiers gave their
lives, set apart in trains, in which they
pay first-class fares for third-class service,
and segregated in railway stations
and in places of entertainment; he
would observe that State after State declines
to do its elementary duty in preparing
the Negro through education
for the best exercise of citizenship.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Added to this, the spread of lawless
attacks upon the Negro, North,
South, and West—even in the Springfield
made famous by Lincoln—often
accompanied by revolting brutalities,
sparing neither sex nor age nor youth,
could but shock the author of the sentiment
that ‘government of the people,
by the people, for the people; should
not perish from the earth.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silence under these conditions
means tacit approval. The indifference
of the North is already responsible for
more than one assault upon democracy,
and every such attack reacts as
unfavorably upon whites as upon
blacks. Discrimination once permitted
cannot be bridled; recent history in the
South shows that in forging chains for
the Negroes the white voters are forging
chains for themselves. ‘A house divided
against itself cannot stand’; this
government cannot exist half-slave and
half-free any better to-day than it could
in 1861.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hence we call upon all the believers
in democracy to join in a national
conference for the discussion of present
evils, the voicing of protests, and
the renewal of the struggle for civil
and political liberty.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>It was thus decided that we should
hold a conference, and the next two
months were busily spent arranging for
it. Among the men and women who
attended those first committee meetings
were, Bishop Alexander Walters, Mr.
Ray Stannard Baker, Mr. Alexander
Irvine, Dr. Owen M. Waller, Mr. Gaylord
S. White, Miss Madeline Z. Doty,
Miss Isabel Eaton, besides many of the
New York signers of the Call. It was
agreed that the conference should be
by invitation only, with the one open
meeting at Cooper Union. Over a
thousand people were invited, the Charity
Organization Hall was secured, and,
on the evening of May 30th, the conference
opened with an informal reception
at the Henry Street Settlement,
given by Miss Lillian D. Wald, one of
the Association’s first and oldest friends.
The next morning our deliberations
began.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have had five conferences since
1909, but I doubt whether any have
been so full of a questioning surprise,
amounting swiftly to enthusiasm, on
the part of the white people in attendance.
These men and women, engaged
in religious, social and educational
work, for the first time met the Negro
who demands, not a pittance, but his
full rights in the commonwealth. They
received a stimulating shock and one
which they enjoyed. They did not want
to leave the meeting. We conferred all
the time, formally and informally, and
the Association gained in those days
many of the earnest and uncompromising
men and women who have since
worked unfalteringly in its cause. Mr.
William Hayes Ward, senior editor of
the <i>Independent</i>, opened the conference,
and Mr. Charles Edward Russell,
always the friend of those who
struggle for opportunity, presided at
the stormy session at the close. The full
proceedings have been published by the
Association.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out of this conference we formed a
committee of forty and secured the services
of Miss Frances Blascoer, as secretary.
We were greatly hampered by
lack of funds. Important national work
would present itself which we were unable
to handle. But our secretary was
an excellent organizer, and at the end
of a year we had held four mass meetings,
had distributed thousands of
pamphlets, and numbered our membership
in the hundreds. In May, 1910,
we held our second conference in New
York, and again our meetings were attended
by earnest, interested people. It
was then that we organized a permanent
body to be known as the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People. Its officers were:</p>

<p class='c007'>National President, Moorfield Storey,
Boston; Chairman of the Executive
Committee, William English Walling;
Treasurer, John E. Milholland; Disbursing
Treasurer, Oswald Garrison
Villard; Executive Secretary, Frances
Blascoer; Director of Publicity and Research,
Dr. W. E. B. DuBois.</p>

<p class='c007'>The securing of a sufficient financial
support to warrant our calling Dr. DuBois
from Atlanta University into an
executive office in the Association was
the most important work of the second
conference.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Dr. DuBois came to us we
were brought closely in touch with an
organization of colored people, formed
in 1905 at Niagara and known as the
Niagara Movement. This organization
had held important conferences at Niagara,
Harpers Ferry, and Boston, and
had attempted a work of legal redress
along very much the lines upon which
the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People was working.
Its platform, as presented in a
statement in 1905, ran as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Freedom of speech and criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>An unfettered and unsubsidized
press.</p>

<p class='c007'>Manhood suffrage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The abolition of all caste distinctions
based simply on race and color.</p>

<p class='c007'>The recognition of the principle of
human brotherhood as a practical present
creed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The recognition of the highest and
best training as the monopoly of no
class or race.</p>

<p class='c007'>A belief in the dignity of labor.</p>

<p class='c007'>United effort to realize these ideals
under wise and courageous leadership.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1910 it had conducted important
civil rights cases and had in its membership
some of the ablest colored
lawyers in the country, with Mr. W.
Ashbie Hawkins, who has since worked
with our Association, on the Baltimore
Segregation acts, as its treasurer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Niagara Movement, hampered
as it was by lack of funds and by a
membership confined to one race only,
continued to push slowly on, but when
the larger possibilities of this new Association
were clear, the members of
the Niagara Movement were advised
to join, as the platforms were practically
identical. Many of the most prominent
members of the Niagara Movement
thus brought their energy and
ability into the service of the Association,
and eight are now serving on its
Board of Directors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our history, after 1910, may be read
in our annual reports, and in the numbers
of <span class='sc'>The Crisis</span>. We opened two
offices in the <i>Evening Post</i> building.
With Dr. DuBois came Mr. Frank M.
Turner, a Wilberforce graduate, who
has shown great efficiency in handling
our books. In November of 1910 appeared
the first number of <span class='sc'>The Crisis</span>,
with Dr. DuBois as editor, and Mary
Dunlop MacLean, whose death has
been the greatest loss the Association
has known, as managing editor. Our
propaganda work was put on a national
footing, our legal work was well
under way and we were in truth, a
National Association, pledged to a nation-wide
work for justice to the Negro
race.</p>

<p class='c007'>I remember the afternoon that <span class='sc'>The
Crisis</span> received its name. We were sitting
around the conventional table that
seems a necessary adjunct to every
Board, and were having an informal
talk regarding the new magazine. We
touched the subject of poetry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is a poem of Lowell’s,” I
said, “that means more to me to-day
than any other poem in the world—‘The
Present Crisis.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Walling looked up. “The Crisis,”
he said. “There is the name for your
magazine, <span class='sc'>The Crisis</span>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And if we had a creed to which our
members, black and white, our branches
North and South and East and West,
our college societies, our children’s
circles, should all subscribe, it should
be the lines of Lowell’s noble verse,
lines that are as true to-day as when
they were written seventy years ago:</p>

      <div class='line'>We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,</div>
      <div class='line'>We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,</div>
      <div class='line'>Out from the gloomy past,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till now we stand at last</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>God of our weary years,</div>
      <div class='line'>God of our silent tears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou who has by Thy might</div>
      <div class='line'>Led us into the light.</div>
      <div class='line'>Keep us forever in the path, we pray.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shadowed beneath Thy hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>May we forever stand.</div>
      <div class='line'>True to our God</div>
      <div class='line'>True to our native land.</div>
