<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c006'>THE National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
is five years old—old enough, it is believed,
to have a history; and I, who
am perhaps its first member, have
been chosen as the person to recite it.
As its work since 1910 has been set
forth in its annual reports, I shall
make it my task to show how it came
into existence and to tell of its first
months of work.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the summer of 1908, the country
was shocked by the account of the race
riots at Springfield, Illinois. Here, in
the home of Abraham Lincoln, a mob
containing many of the town’s “best
citizens,” raged for two days, killed and
wounded scores of Negroes, and drove
thousands from the city. Articles on
the subject appeared in newspapers and
magazines. Among them was one in the
<i>Independent</i> of September 3d, by William
English Walling, entitled “Race
War in the North.” After describing
the atrocities committed against the
colored people, Mr. Walling declared:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Either the spirit of the abolitionists,
of Lincoln and of Lovejoy must
be revived and we must come to treat
the Negro on a plane of absolute political
and social equality, or Vardaman
and Tillman will soon have transferred
the race war to the North.” And
he ended with these words, “Yet who
realizes the seriousness of the situation,
and what large and powerful body of
citizens is ready to come to their aid?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It so happened that one of Mr. Walling’s
readers accepted his question and
answered it. For four years I had been
studying the status of the Negro in
New York. I had investigated his housing
conditions, his health, his opportunities
for work. I had spent many
months in the South, and at the time
of Mr. Walling’s article, I was living
in a New York Negro tenement on a
Negro street. And my investigations and
my surroundings led me to believe with
the writer of the article that “the spirit
of the abolitionists must be revived.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So I wrote to Mr. Walling, and after
some time, for he was in the West, we
met in New York in the first week of
the year 1909. With us was Dr. Henry
Moskowitz, now prominent in the administration
of John Purroy Mitchell,
Mayor of New York. It was then that
the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People was born.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was born in a little room of a
New York apartment. It is to be regretted
that there are no minutes of
the first meeting, for they would make
interesting if unparliamentary reading.
Mr. Walling had spent some years in
Russia where his wife, working in the
cause of the revolutionists, had suffered
imprisonment; and he expressed his belief
that the Negro was treated with
greater inhumanity in the United
States than the Jew was treated in Russia.
As Mr. Walling is a Southerner we
listened with conviction. I knew something
of the Negro’s difficulty in securing
decent employment in the North
and of the insolent treatment awarded
him at Northern hotels and restaurants,
and I voiced my protest. Dr. Moskowitz,
with his broad knowledge of conditions
among New York’s helpless immigrants,
aided us in properly interpreting
our facts. And so we talked
and talked voicing our indignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, we wanted to do something
at once that should move the
country. It was January. Why not
choose Lincoln’s birthday, February 12,
to open our campaign? We decided,
therefore, that a wise, immediate action
would be the issuing on Lincoln’s
birthday of a call for a national conference
on the Negro question. At this
conference we might discover the beginnings,
at least, of that “large and
powerful body of citizens” of which Mr.
Walling had written.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so the meeting adjourned. Something
definite was determined upon, and
our next step was to call others into
our councils. We at once turned to
Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard, president
of the N.Y. Evening Post Company.
He received our suggestions with enthusiasm,
and aided us in securing the
co-operation of able and representative
men and women. It was he who drafted
the Lincoln’s birthday call and helped
to give it wide publicity. I give the
Call in its entirety with the signatures
since it expresses, I think, better than
anything else we have published, the
spirit of those who are active in the
Association’s cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The celebration of the Centennial
of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, widespread
and grateful as it may be, will
fail to justify itself if it takes no note
of and makes no recognition of the
colored men and women for whom the
great Emancipator labored to assure
freedom. Besides a day of rejoicing,
Lincoln’s birthday in 1909 should be
one of taking stock of the nation’s progress
since 1865.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How far has it lived up to the obligations
imposed upon it by the Emancipation
Proclamation? How far has it
gone in assuring to each and every citizen,
irrespective of color, the equality
of opportunity and equality before the
law, which underlie our American institutions
and are guaranteed by the
Constitution?</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Mr. Lincoln could revisit this
country in the flesh, he would be disheartened
and discouraged. He would
learn that on January 1, 1909, Georgia
had rounded out a new confederacy
by disfranchising the Negro, after the
manner of all the other Southern States.
He would learn that the Supreme Court
of the United States, supposedly a bulwark
of American liberties, had refused
every opportunity to pass squarely upon
this disfranchisement of millions, by
laws avowedly discriminatory and openly
enforced in such manner that the
white men may vote and black men
be without a vote in their government;
he would discover, therefore, that taxation
without representation is the lot
of millions of wealth-producing American
citizens, in whose hands rests the
economic progress and welfare of an
entire section of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He would learn that the Supreme
Court, according to the official statement
of one of its own judges in the
Berea College case, has laid down the
principle that if an individual State
chooses, it may ‘make it a crime for
white and colored persons to frequent
the same market place at the same time,
or appear in an assemblage of citizens
convened to consider questions of a
public or political nature in which all
citizens, without regard to race, are
equally interested.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“In many states Lincoln would find
justice enforced, if at all, by judges
elected by one element in a community
to pass upon the liberties and lives of
another. He would see the black men
and women, for whose freedom a hundred
thousand of soldiers gave their
lives, set apart in trains, in which they
pay first-class fares for third-class service,
and segregated in railway stations
and in places of entertainment; he
would observe that State after State declines
to do its elementary duty in preparing
the Negro through education
for the best exercise of citizenship.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Added to this, the spread of lawless
attacks upon the Negro, North,
South, and West—even in the Springfield
made famous by Lincoln—often
accompanied by revolting brutalities,
sparing neither sex nor age nor youth,
could but shock the author of the sentiment
that ‘government of the people,
by the people, for the people; should
not perish from the earth.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silence under these conditions
means tacit approval. The indifference
of the North is already responsible for
more than one assault upon democracy,
and every such attack reacts as
unfavorably upon whites as upon
blacks. Discrimination once permitted
cannot be bridled; recent history in the
South shows that in forging chains for
the Negroes the white voters are forging
chains for themselves. ‘A house divided
against itself cannot stand’; this
government cannot exist half-slave and
half-free any better to-day than it could
in 1861.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hence we call upon all the believers
in democracy to join in a national
conference for the discussion of present
evils, the voicing of protests, and
the renewal of the struggle for civil
and political liberty.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>It was thus decided that we should
hold a conference, and the next two
months were busily spent arranging for
it. Among the men and women who
attended those first committee meetings
were, Bishop Alexander Walters, Mr.
Ray Stannard Baker, Mr. Alexander
Irvine, Dr. Owen M. Waller, Mr. Gaylord
S. White, Miss Madeline Z. Doty,
Miss Isabel Eaton, besides many of the
New York signers of the Call. It was
agreed that the conference should be
by invitation only, with the one open
meeting at Cooper Union. Over a
thousand people were invited, the Charity
Organization Hall was secured, and,
on the evening of May 30th, the conference
opened with an informal reception
at the Henry Street Settlement,
given by Miss Lillian D. Wald, one of
the Association’s first and oldest friends.
The next morning our deliberations
began.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have had five conferences since
1909, but I doubt whether any have
been so full of a questioning surprise,
amounting swiftly to enthusiasm, on
the part of the white people in attendance.
These men and women, engaged
in religious, social and educational
work, for the first time met the Negro
who demands, not a pittance, but his
full rights in the commonwealth. They
received a stimulating shock and one
which they enjoyed. They did not want
to leave the meeting. We conferred all
the time, formally and informally, and
the Association gained in those days
many of the earnest and uncompromising
men and women who have since
worked unfalteringly in its cause. Mr.
William Hayes Ward, senior editor of
the <i>Independent</i>, opened the conference,
and Mr. Charles Edward Russell,
always the friend of those who
struggle for opportunity, presided at
the stormy session at the close. The full
proceedings have been published by the
Association.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out of this conference we formed a
committee of forty and secured the services
of Miss Frances Blascoer, as secretary.
We were greatly hampered by
lack of funds. Important national work
would present itself which we were unable
to handle. But our secretary was
an excellent organizer, and at the end
of a year we had held four mass meetings,
had distributed thousands of
pamphlets, and numbered our membership
in the hundreds. In May, 1910,
we held our second conference in New
York, and again our meetings were attended
by earnest, interested people. It
was then that we organized a permanent
body to be known as the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People. Its officers were:</p>

<p class='c007'>National President, Moorfield Storey,
Boston; Chairman of the Executive
Committee, William English Walling;
Treasurer, John E. Milholland; Disbursing
Treasurer, Oswald Garrison
Villard; Executive Secretary, Frances
Blascoer; Director of Publicity and Research,
Dr. W. E. B. DuBois.</p>

<p class='c007'>The securing of a sufficient financial
support to warrant our calling Dr. DuBois
from Atlanta University into an
executive office in the Association was
the most important work of the second
conference.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Dr. DuBois came to us we
were brought closely in touch with an
organization of colored people, formed
in 1905 at Niagara and known as the
Niagara Movement. This organization
had held important conferences at Niagara,
Harpers Ferry, and Boston, and
had attempted a work of legal redress
along very much the lines upon which
the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People was working.
Its platform, as presented in a
statement in 1905, ran as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Freedom of speech and criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>An unfettered and unsubsidized
press.</p>

<p class='c007'>Manhood suffrage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The abolition of all caste distinctions
based simply on race and color.</p>

<p class='c007'>The recognition of the principle of
human brotherhood as a practical present
creed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The recognition of the highest and
best training as the monopoly of no
class or race.</p>

<p class='c007'>A belief in the dignity of labor.</p>

<p class='c007'>United effort to realize these ideals
under wise and courageous leadership.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1910 it had conducted important
civil rights cases and had in its membership
some of the ablest colored
lawyers in the country, with Mr. W.
Ashbie Hawkins, who has since worked
with our Association, on the Baltimore
Segregation acts, as its treasurer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Niagara Movement, hampered
as it was by lack of funds and by a
membership confined to one race only,
continued to push slowly on, but when
the larger possibilities of this new Association
were clear, the members of
the Niagara Movement were advised
to join, as the platforms were practically
identical. Many of the most prominent
members of the Niagara Movement
thus brought their energy and
ability into the service of the Association,
and eight are now serving on its
Board of Directors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our history, after 1910, may be read
in our annual reports, and in the numbers
of <span class='sc'>The Crisis</span>. We opened two
offices in the <i>Evening Post</i> building.
With Dr. DuBois came Mr. Frank M.
Turner, a Wilberforce graduate, who
has shown great efficiency in handling
our books. In November of 1910 appeared
the first number of <span class='sc'>The Crisis</span>,
with Dr. DuBois as editor, and Mary
Dunlop MacLean, whose death has
been the greatest loss the Association
has known, as managing editor. Our
propaganda work was put on a national
footing, our legal work was well
under way and we were in truth, a
National Association, pledged to a nation-wide
work for justice to the Negro
race.</p>

<p class='c007'>I remember the afternoon that <span class='sc'>The
Crisis</span> received its name. We were sitting
around the conventional table that
seems a necessary adjunct to every
Board, and were having an informal
talk regarding the new magazine. We
touched the subject of poetry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is a poem of Lowell’s,” I
said, “that means more to me to-day
than any other poem in the world—‘The
Present Crisis.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Walling looked up. “The Crisis,”
he said. “There is the name for your
magazine, <span class='sc'>The Crisis</span>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And if we had a creed to which our
members, black and white, our branches
North and South and East and West,
our college societies, our children’s
circles, should all subscribe, it should
be the lines of Lowell’s noble verse,
lines that are as true to-day as when
they were written seventy years ago:</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
